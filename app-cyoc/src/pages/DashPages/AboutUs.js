                CYOC (Create Your Own Car) is an innovative platform designed for automotive
                designers to explore their creativity and experiment with unique vehicle model
                combinations. Our tool allows for visualization and customization of designs,
                giving users the opportunity to bring their ideas to life. Whether you are a
                seasoned designer or just starting out, CYOC offers a user-friendly interface
                that makes the design process enjoyable and intuitive.

                At CYOC, you will not only be able to create your own vehicles but also share
                your creations with a passionate community. Our forum is a space for designers
                to connect, collaborate, and critique each other's work. Here, you can receive
                valuable feedback from fellow designers, which can help you improve and refine
                your skills in automotive design. We believe that sharing knowledge and
                experiences leads to better designs and fosters a supportive environment for
                creativity.

                The CYOC project is brought to life by a dedicated team of four developers:
                Santino, Tobias, Matias, and Nahuel. Each of us brings unique skills and
                perspectives to the table. Santino focuses on front-end development, ensuring
                that the user interface is both beautiful and functional. Tobias handles back-end
                development, working tirelessly to maintain a robust and secure database. Matias
                specializes in user experience (UX) design, making sure that the platform is
                intuitive and engaging for all users. Nahuel oversees project management, keeping
                us on track and ensuring that our goals align with the needs of our community.

                We are all passionate about technology and committed to creating a platform that
                inspires creativity and innovation. Our goal is to continually enhance CYOC by
                incorporating user feedback and adding new features that will make the design
                experience even more enjoyable. We envision a space where automotive designers
                can thrive, experiment, and ultimately shape the future of vehicle design.
